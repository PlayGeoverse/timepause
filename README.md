# timepause
Pause the time when no-one is around.

## What does it do?
Pretty simple, as said above - it pauses the in-game time when all players leave the server, and continues it when a player joins the server.

## Why did you make this?
So players don't spawn in the middle of the night after they leave for 10 minutes, surrounded by 300,000 creepers. 😁

## Installation guide:
1. Download the latest release on the sidebar to the right.
2. Throw this in the `datapacks` folder of your existing world.

## IDE Setup:
